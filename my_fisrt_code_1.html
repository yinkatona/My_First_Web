<b>Basics into how the Web Works</b>
<p> Understanding how the web interract is very important in the building of the foundational knowledge to becoming a good programmer.<br> The following element must be considered and this include<br>  
<em>Web</em>: They are collections of <b>HTML</b> documents. Invented in the early 1990, but its remarkable to see how this great tool has revolutionized the entire planet.<br> 
<br>
<em>HTML</em>(HyperText Markup Language): This is what makes up the web and forms the documents that are presented.<br> It also helps to connect web pages with what is known as <b>Hyperlinks</b>. <p>When there is Hyperlink on a page (it can be in form of sentence, word or collection of alpha-numeric write ups with special symbols)<br> it appears blue, and when it is clicked it automatically directs to another page.<br> 
<br>
<em>URL</em>(Uniform Resource Locator): This is how the webpages are described on the internet.<br>
<br>
<em>HTTP</em>(HyperText Transfer Protocol):This is the Language used to communicate with the <em>Server</em> via this internet.<br> 
<p>The response received from the server is interpreted by the <em>Browser</em> and it is displayed in the form we understand.<br>
<br>
<em>Web Application</em>
</p>

<b>Understanding HTML</b> 
<p>The HTML plays a significant role in the connectivity and functionality of the web.<br> It is refer to as the <em>"heart"</em> of the web.It is made up of the following<br>
-<em>Text content</em> <br>
-<em>Markups</em>: this is how contents are arranged on the web<br>
-<em>Reference to other document</em> such as images and videos<br>
-<em>Link to Other Pages</em> 
</p>

<b>Stepping into The World of Coding</b><br>
<p>It is worthy to note that HTMl <em>Editor</em> is require to write code.<br> Code are written for computer in a sytematic and sequential manner to give sets of instruction.<br> 
Codes are also written for man and when you by observing the rules of coding you become a good Programmer.<br>Just like writting essay, ability to imput indentation as appropriate makes a good writter.<br> But in coding the indentation is referred to as the "Tag"
</p>

 The element in the tag comprises of<br>
-Opening tag<br>
-Content<br>
-Closing tag<br>
<b>HTML Tags</b>
<p>There are different types of tags which indicate to the browser the way to display.<br>
1.<b>b-Tag</b>:stands for bold tag<br>
Example: I am <em>delighted</em> Learning coding<br>
2.<b>em-Tag</b> stands for emphasis.This is tag for italicizing text<br>
Example: udacity is <em>my favorite</em><br>
3.<b>Missing End Tag</b>: if the closing tag is not added at the a end of statement, the statement from the opening tag will be italicized<br>
4.<b>Making Links</b>(<em>HTML Attribute</em>):
Links plays a significant role as to how the web connects<br>
Example of tag that uses a link is the <b>Anchor Tag (a-tag)</b>-it is for making links.<br>
# It usually takes the form (tag= Attr"value")content(/tag)<br>
# Simply put, it can express as;(a href="www.udacity.com")my favourite(/a). From the expression above "my favourite" <br>becomes the link by turning blue. it links to www.udacity.com, when run in html editor.<br>
Note:the use of "(" instead of "<" was deliberate. it was intended to make the expression readable.<br>
5.<b>Image Tag</b>:It is often written as "img" for adding images on the web.<br>
It is surprising to note that image tag is a <em>Void Tag</em>. Hence it neither has content nor Closing tag.<br>
# It is therefore express as (img scr="url" alt="text"). The "scr" stands for the source, "Url" for the image to be displayed.<br> "alt" which stands for alternative-the text displayed when the image doesnt load.<br>
Example:(img scr="https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=garfield&view=detailv2&&id=5B826B9DC2C6ACEA0190989B1A9F03C2FC359D2E&<br>selectedIndex=0&ccid=J8xy1qVf&simid=608023368513159714&<br>thid=OIP.M27cc72d6a55fcfe9ccb63d695746a6a9H0&ajaxhist=0" alt="rexwallpapers.com").<br> The url(the funny looking characters with alpha-numeric text) stands for the image address on the web.<br>
If we run the text in html editor, the image displays and if it doesnt,<br> the alternate text is required so that it display if the image doesnt load. it is refer to as <em>"broken request"</em>. 
</p>
<b>Other HTML Element</b>
<p>The <b>Break Tag</b> create line break and it is describe in the editor as "br". It is a void tag and can be used repeatedly to create multiple lines.<br>
<b>The "p" tag</b> stands for Paragraph. It can create line break but must be rapped around sentences it is applied.<br>
<b>Inline Vs Block</b>:<em>Inline</em> tag ends a line, and it include "b", "em","img" tags<br> while the <em>Block</em> tag create an invisible line around a text and example of such tag is the "p" tag.<br>
<b>Span and Div</b>:<em>Span</em> create inline elemenet. <em>Div</em> create block containing elemnet
